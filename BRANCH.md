# About

  This is the `incubator/stylesheets/glamor` branch of the `react-universally` starter kit.

  It provides you with the build tooling and configuration you need to kick off your next universal react project with full support for Glamor.

  Look into `Header` and `Menu` components to check how the wrappers for these are styled using Glamor.

## What is Glamor?

  [Glamor](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor) is an Inline CSS for React components.
